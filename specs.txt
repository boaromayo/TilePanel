	make a chunk of characters/integers for console output for debug
	make a chunk of tiles
	
	make limit of tiles in one chunk
	
	constructor
		initialize number of tiles in a chunk
		initialize size of one tile
		initialize row and column limits

	load the chunk
		if file loads ok
			call in file reader
			set white space as delimiter
		
			for each row in the chunk
				read one line of file
				split each character to their separate tokens, delimiter separates the tokens
			
				for each column
					read each character token
					insert a tile and character into respective chunks
			
		else

	draw tiles
		for each row
			for each column
				draw the tile

	set position
	get tile size
	get row and column
	get chunk
	get chunk size
	set and get tile character index
	
	replace tiles
		ask the character
		for each row
			for each column
				access index and replace tile with inputted character
